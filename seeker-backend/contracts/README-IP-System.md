# Intellectual Property Asset Management System

A comprehensive smart contract system built on Hedera for managing intellectual property assets, licensing, and revenue distribution through NFTs and automated royalty vaults.

## Overview

This system allows creators to:
- **Register IP assets** as NFTs with encrypted content storage
- **Attach license terms** with customizable pricing and revenue sharing
- **Mint license tokens** for users to access IP assets
- **Receive payments** and automatically distribute royalties
- **Transfer ownership** of IP assets with associated NFTs
- **Manage revenue sharing** between asset owners and licensees

## Architecture

The system consists of three main contracts:

### 1. IPAssetNFT (`IPAssetNFT.sol`)
- ERC721 NFT contract representing IP asset ownership
- Minted automatically when IP assets are registered
- Integrated with the IP Asset Manager for controlled minting/burning

### 2. IPAssetManagerV2 (`IPAssetManagerV2.sol`)
- Core contract managing IP assets, licenses, and revenue
- Handles asset registration, licensing, and royalty distribution
- Integrates with Hedera Token Service for blockchain operations

### 3. IPAssetSystemDeployer (`deploy-ip-system.sol`)
- Deployment script that sets up the entire system
- Links contracts and sets proper ownership relationships

## Usage Examples

### 1. Register an IP Asset

```solidity
// Register a book as an IP asset
uint256 assetId = await ipAssetManager.registerIPAsset(
    "My Creative Book",
    "A revolutionary book about blockchain technology",
    "ipfs://QmExampleMetadataHash",
    "QmExampleIPFSHash"
);
```

### 2. Attach License Terms

```solidity
// Attach commercial license terms
await ipAssetManager.attachLicenseTerms(
    assetId,
    "Commercial use allowed with attribution",
    ethers.parseEther("100"), // 100 KES
    365 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 1 year
    10, // Max 10 licenses
    ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes("encrypted_terms")),
    2000 // 20% revenue share
);
```

### 3. Mint a License

```solidity
// User purchases a license
await ipAssetManager.mintLicenseToken(
    assetId,
    licenseId,
    { value: ethers.parseEther("100") }
);
```

### 4. Pay Revenue

```solidity
// Pay revenue for book sales
await ipAssetManager.payIPAsset(
    assetId,
    "Book sales revenue",
    { value: ethers.parseEther("1000") }
);
```

### 5. Claim Royalties

```solidity
// Asset owner claims royalties
await ipAssetManager.claimRoyalties(assetId);

// Licensee claims royalties
await ipAssetManager.claimRoyalties(assetId);
```

## Revenue Distribution

The system automatically distributes revenue based on license terms:

1. **Asset Owner**: Receives the remaining percentage after licensee shares
2. **Licensees**: Receive their configured revenue share percentage
3. **Distribution**: Happens automatically when revenue is paid
4. **Claiming**: Users must actively claim their royalties

### Example Revenue Flow

```
Revenue: 1000 KES
Licensee Share: 20% (200 KES)
Asset Owner Share: 80% (800 KES)

Licensee receives: 200 KES
Asset Owner receives: 800 KES
```

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only asset owners can modify their assets
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Ownership Verification**: Ensures only authorized users can perform actions
- **Payment Validation**: Verifies sufficient payment for licenses
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate IPFS hash registration

## Events

The system emits comprehensive events for tracking:

- `IPAssetRegistered`: When a new IP asset is registered
- `LicenseTermsAttached`: When license terms are attached
- `LicenseTokenMinted`: When a license token is minted
- `RevenueReceived`: When revenue is paid to an asset
- `RoyaltyClaimed`: When royalties are claimed
- `LicenseTokenRevoked`: When a license is revoked
- `IPAssetTransferred`: When asset ownership is transferred

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy the System

```solidity
// Deploy the entire system
IPAssetSystemDeployer deployer = new IPAssetSystemDeployer();

// Get deployed addresses
(address nftContract, address managerContract) = deployer.getDeployedAddresses();
```

### 2. Set Ownership

```solidity
// Transfer manager ownership to desired address
deployer.transferManagerOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
```

### 3. Verify Integration

```solidity
// Verify NFT contract is linked to manager
address manager = await ipAssetNFT.ipAssetManager();
require(manager == managerContractAddress, "Integration failed");
```
